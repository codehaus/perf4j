/**
 * Provides annotations that work with an aspect-oriented framework like AspectJ or Spring AOP to allow timing
 * of code blocks without explicit logging statements. The {@link org.perf4j.aop.Profiled} annotation can be added to
 * method declarations to indicate that method execution should be timed, e.g.:
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Profiled(tag = "servlet{$this.servletName}_{$0.pathInfo}")
 * protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) {
 * ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Timing code can then be enabled using the concrete subclasses of {@link org.perf4j.aop.AbstractTimingAspect}, such
 * as the log4j {@link org.perf4j.log4j.aop.TimingAspect}. You will need to use an aspect framework such as AspectJ
 * or Spring AOP to enable these aspects.
 * <p>
 * In addition, if you are using an aspect framework that doesn't use the AspectJ annotations, you can wrap or subclass
 * {@link org.perf4j.aop.AgnosticTimingAspect} in a manner to work with your framework's requirements.
