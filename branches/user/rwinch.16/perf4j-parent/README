Thanks for the quick response, sorry I did not return the favor. I have finally committed the changes. A summary is below:

I have created perfj4dao and a jdbc implementation for the dao. There are integration tests for MySQL, H2 Database, HSQL, & Oracle10g. With that said there is some setup required to do the installs. You can find the required setup at perf4j-parent/src/site/apt/contributors.apt There is also an example of how to persist & graph with the database in the examples modules. Details on deploying it with jetty are at perf4j-parent/examples/dao-graphing-servlet/src/site/apt/running.apt I would like to get some feeback from the community on what is there and not there. Especially on how we should allow queries to create graphs. I have given some thought for it and outlined it in the javadoc.

I've noticed that there is some strange behavior in the way that the graphs are being displayed. The datapoints do not seem to connect correctly. I think this is due to the ordering of the results returned from the database, but have not investigated further. Some example graphs I got are below.

PS: I have problems with some of the pre-existing tests that fail in trunk. Sometimes they pass others and sometimes they fail.
